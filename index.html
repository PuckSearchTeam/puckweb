            <p>Welcome to the <strong>Puck</strong> Plugin page! Here you can find the latest downloads, updates, and instructions for using the Puck Plugin with IntelliJ.</p>
            <p><strong>Weland</strong> is a language interpreted by Puck to express coupling constraints rules. It provides the definition of sets containing of Java code entities such as package, class, attribute, method/constructor. Its core predicate is of the form "hide X from Y", where X and Y are sets.
            This rule expresses that no element in Y must not depend on any element of X. In other words, no element of X can appear in the scope of any element of Y</p>
            <p><strong>Puck</strong> is an architecture refactoring tool designed to enhance your development experience by providing bad dependencies identification within IntelliJ. It dynamically generates and highlights within the code all violations of Weland dependency rules.</p>
            <p><strong>Puck</strong> and <strong>Weland</strong> are developed by the <a href="https://www.lip6.fr/recherche/team.php?acronyme=MoVe">Move</a> team at <a href="http://www.lip6.fr">LIP6</a>, <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/">Sorbonne Universit√©</a>.</p>
